# Cryptography-
This project focus on Caesar Cipher and Vernam Cipher method implemented using Java GUI. 
Cryptography is the technique that is used for secure communication between two parties in a public environment where unauthorized users and malicious attackers are present. In cryptography, there are two processes i.e. encryption and decryption performed at the sender and receiver end respectively. Encryption is the process where simple multimedia data is combined with some additional data (known as a key) and converted into an unreadable encoded format known as a Cipher. Decryption is the reverse method of encryption where the same or different additional data (key) is used to decode the cipher and it is converted into real multimedia data.

The Vernam cipher is, in theory, a perfect cipher. Instead of a single key, each plain text character is encrypted using its own key. This means that there is no way that the cipher text can be deciphered without the key.
